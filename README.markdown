# [Rattletrap][]

Rattletrap parses and generates [Rocket League][] replays.

## Install

Rattletrap does not yet offer compiled binaries for download. To install it,
first install [Stack][]. Then download or clone this repository and run
`stack --install-ghc install`.

## Parse

Rattletrap can parse Rocket League replays and output them as JSON.

``` sh
> rattletrap parse input.replay output.json
```

The resulting JSON is minified, but extremely large. A 22 KB replay file turns
into a 267 KB JSON file. To easily view the file, use a JSON pretty printer and
a pager. For example:

``` sh
> cat output.json | python -m json.tool | less
```

## Generate

Rattletrap can also generate Rocket League replays from JSON files.

``` sh
> rattletrap generate input.json output.replay
```

If the JSON was generated by Rattletrap, the resulting replay should be
identical to the original.
